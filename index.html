            <li>Born in Paoli, Indiana.</li>
            <li>Graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.</li>
            <li>Started out in mathematics at the University of Michigan.</li>
            <li>Earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College in 1958.</li>
            <li>Took an interim position in 1960 at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department; in which at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines.</li>
            <li>Worked on the SAGE Project at Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.</li>
            <li>Led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab.</li>
            <li>Began to use the term "software engineering" during the early Apollo missions in order to give software the legitimacy of other fields such as hardware engineering; over time the term "software engineering" has gained the same respect as any other discipline.</li>
            <li>The CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT.</li>
            <li>The founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</li>
            <li>Developed around the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems and software design.</li>
